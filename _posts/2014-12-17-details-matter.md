Nearly a year I joined the—not quite as crazy as I thought, but with a **lot** more pulled pork than I could have ever imagined—world of startups, in London. I was offered a job by the amazing guys at Gitter. Few months in, and I s**t you not: I have learned more than I had ever though possible at university, by 10-fold.

I want to take some time to talk about the 2 things that I believe are the most valuable lessons that I've learned so far. These are:

1. Software is about people.
2. Detail Matters.

The first point hit me like a train. How could it not have? I'd been writing software from my accommodation, or in the labs. On my own. Read about it.

I simply love this, features are great, but experiences are amazing... experiences make you **love** a product. Here's an example from something that we thought about at Gitter.

This to me is great. It's such a small part of the experience but it adds so much. To me it is what software is about, subtle moments of realisation of how lazy we can be.
